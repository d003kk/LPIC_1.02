+++++++++++++++++INSTALL A BOOT MANAGER++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++lilo and Grub++++++++++++++++++++

During booting, boot loaders need to know
	
	1) Which directory the linux kernel is in usually \boot.
	2) Which device is the root device.

Boot sequence looks something like this

	BOOTLOADER->KERNEL->/sbin/init

Alternatively a Boot loader can load a RAM disk into memory which contains scripts on 
how to access the root device. This will be the case when the root device is handled by non
resident dynamic modules.

	BOOTLOADER->INITRD->KERNEL->/sbin/initrd

Common extended modules

	ext3:	Third extended file system.
	lvm:	Logical volume support.
	raidx:	Software raid level x support.
	scsi:	scsi support.


++++++++++++++++++++++Installing LILLO++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Lilo is installed in /sbin/lilo

Which in turn reads configuration form /etc/lilo.conf

Lilo cannot read filesystems only offsets upon disks, thus lilo will read information from 
/etc/lilo.conf and translate this information using a series of maps to be read by lilo at boot type

Main /etc/lilo.conf options.

	boot:		The device upon which Lilo has been installed e.g /dev/hda is the MBR
	
	install:	Which second stage to install (boot.b is default)

	prompt:		Give the user a chance to decide which OS to boot
	
	timeout:	The ammount of time to prompt (units tenths of seconds)
	
	label:		Name of the image that user types at the prompt

	default:	Name of the image which will be booted by default

	image:		Path to the kernel to boot (One can use "other" for a chain loader)

	root:		Name of the device which contains the root / file system.

	read-only:	Mount the file system readonly so that fsck will work.

	append:		Give parameters to a kernel which is statically compiled.

	linear/lba3:	These options are mutually exclusive. Ask lilo to read the disk using Linear block addressing typically used for
			very large disks. lba3 allows boot time access beyond 1024 cyclinder of the disk.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++Installing Grub++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Grub is installed with the command

	grub-install

Configuration files are stored within

	/boot/grub/menu.lst

or
	/boot/grub/grub.conf

Unlike LILO grub is a small shell which can read file systems. This allows grub to read data directly from /boot/grub/menu.lst
or from /boot/grub/grub.conf

Main options in /boot/grub/menu.lst or /boot/grub/grub.conf


Global

	default:	The default image which will be booted (first on the list)

	timeout:	Prompt timeout in seconds.

Per Image


	title:		Name of the image

	root:		Where the second stage boot loader and kernel are e.g (hd0,0) is /dev/dha

	kernel:		Path to the kernel starting from the previous root e.g /vmlinuz2 

	ro:		read only

	root:		The root file system (Name of the device ???????)

	initrd:		Path to the initial root disk.


+++++++++++++++++++++++Passing Parameters to Boot Loader+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is possible to pass parameters at boot time to both lilo and to grub

+++++++++Passing parameters to lilo prompt+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	boot: linux s

+++++++++Passing parameters at the Grub prompt+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Once grub has succesfully started you will see the main menu screen and a list of parameters 


Do the following

	1) Press 'e' to edit a given parameter

	2) scroll down to the line containing kernel and press e again

	3) You can add any option here.

	3) To boot with the altered options press b, otherwise press enter to get back the unaltered line.

Pressing ESC allows you to navigate back to the main menu.

Fortunately the boot loader configuration files /etc/lilo.conf, /boot/grub/menu.lst or /boot/grub/grub.conf allow you to save can be used to save these options.

+++++++++++++++++Passing init parameters+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Boot loaders can pass the runlevel to init

Once the kernel is loaded it will start /sbin/init

If no parameter is passed init will use the default value specfied in /etc/inittab

+++++++++++++++++++++Common kernel parameters++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


	acpi=:	Toggle ACPI

	init:=	Tell the kernel which program to start from the root device.

	mem:=	Specify the ammount of RAM to use.

	root:= 	Specify the root device.

In etc/lilo.conf the parameters are recorded using "append" e.g

	append= "pci=bisoirq"
	ram= 16M
	


During boot all kernel messages are log in /var/log/dmesg, this file can be read or flushed to standard out /bin/dmesg






	



		
	




+++++++++++++++++SHELLS, SCRIPTING, PROGRAMMING, COMPILING+++++++++++++++++++++++++

+++++++++++++++++++Built In Shell Functions+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	set:	Without options will display the name and value of each shell variable in a format which
		can be used for setting or resetting variables.

	OPTIONS

			-a
				Mark variables and functions which have been modified or created
				for export to the environment of subsequent commands	
				
	

	unset:	Will remove an option from those displayed by set. -f will remove functions -v will remove variables.
		The exit status for unset is true unless  a name is read only

	

++++++++++++++++++++Shell environment variables++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
bash does not require them to be lower case but they are lower case for human readability.

EDITOR:		vi or emacs make your choice.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++alias++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Remember no spaces allowed


	$alias cp='cp -i'

typing alias on its own allows you to see all of the aliases that have been set.	

	
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++Functions++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


[function] name() {command-list;}

function are allowed to be spread over more than one line at a time.

Function arguements are as follows

	$1, $2 etc positional arguements to the function

	$# The number of arguement passed to the function.

++++++++++++++++ADMINSTRATIVE TASK++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++User Accounts+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	/etc/passwd

	Username:Password:UID:GID:comment:home directory: default shell

Username: Treats capitals and lowercase differently so, you can have both Elle and elle on the		same machine.			

UID: positive integers. 0 is uid of root, if you see another account with uid 0 you should be worried that your system has been comprimised

GID: default group of the user

default: can be set to /bin/false so that a user cannot login but can access mail via a remote client such as POP or IMAP. a variant of this scheme uses /bin/passwd which allows the user 		to login and change their password.	

++++++++++++++++Groups+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	/etc/group

	groupname:passwd:GID:group member list:

passwd: If empty group  does not require a passwd

The user will have a primary group to which the belong, traditionally (Suse Debian) this is called "users" and has GID 
100

The User Private Group schem (UPG) was introduced by RedHat and changes this convention without changing the way in which
UNIX groups work. With UPG each new user blenogs to their own primary group. The has the same name as the login-name and GID in the range 500-6000

As a consequence, when using the traditional scheme for groups the users umask is set to 022 whereas in the UPG scheme the umask is set to 002

At any one time only one of the users groups is effective. To change to another effective group the user can call

	newgrp

After newgrp command has been issued calling "groups" will cause the new group to come first.

If the group passwd is set then even users that are not members of the particular group
can use newgrp to gain access to the group.

The list of groups a users has access to can be found by using the "groups" or "id" command.

SYNOPSIS

	host {name} [server]

DESCRIPTION

	host is a simple utility which can lookup names or ip addresses

	name is the domain name that is to be looked up. It can also be a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. In which case host will by default perform a reverse
	lookup for that address. 

	server is an optional argument which is either the name or ip address that host should querry rather then the servers listed in /etc/resolve.conf

OPTIONS

	-a 
		option is equivalent to setting the -v option and asking host to make a querry of type ANY

	-N 
		option sets the number of dots that have to be in name for it to be considered absolute. The default value is that define using the ndots statement in /etc/resolve.conf, or 
		1 if no ndots statement is present. Names with fewer dot are considered as relative names and will be searched for in the domains listed in the search or domain directive 
		in /etc/resolve.conf


	-4 	forces host to only user IPv4 querry transport

	-6	forces host only user IPv6 querry transport

DESCRIPTION

	The resolver is a set of routines in the C library which provide access to the Internet Domain Name System


OPTIONS

	nameserver	Name Server IP address

		Internet address in dot notation of a name server that the resolver should query. 3 servers maybe listed per keyword, and they are searched in order. If no 
		nameservers are present the default is to use the nameserver on the local machine.

	domain		Local Domain Name

		Most queries for names within this domain can use short names relative to the local domain. If no domain entry is present, the domain is determined

SYNOPSIS
	if{up,down,status,probe} <configuration-name><hardware-description>[-o options]

Notation:

	Device: Always a peice of hardware
	Interface: Name that a device gets once it has been registered.
	Configuation: Is a set of parameters which are associated with an interface

DESCRIPTION

ifup:		Is used to bring up a preconfigured interface for networking it is usually invoked by the network script at boot time or by PCMCIA/hotplug system

ifdown:		Sets down the interface and flushes all its addresses. Its is possible to check if the interface is still being used before setting it down. If configured
		it may then get rid of the using processes or refuse setting it down. To configure investigate /set/sysconfig/network/config

ifstatus:	Check if interface and its routes are configured correctly

ifprobe		Checks to see if any of the configuration files have been changed since the interface was up

<hardware-description>	As there is no fixed relation between the device and name of the interface received from the kernel
			it maybe necessary to specify the hardware exactly. The hardware description might be the current interface name, the MAC address or the 
			bus or the bus location where the device resides. It has to be compliant with the device naming rules specified in getcfg. ifup uses getcfg to obtain
			all missing information for example the interface name of a device with given hardware-description. ifup uses getcfg also to get the best matching
			configuration for the interface. Every configuration is stored in files below /etc/sysconfig/network which are named ifcfg-<configuration-name>

<configuration-name>	Name of the configuration which should be used to setup the interface. It may be used to circumvent the automatic search for a configuration with getcfg. In this case the
			the configuration names are not restricted. So for exampe if you have a configuration file ifcfg-my_special you may call ifup ifcfg-my_special <hrd-descr>

OPTIONS

The following are options to be specified after the -o switch

	auto:		Only set up the interface if the configuration has STARTMODE=auto (or boot, onboot or hotplug)


	boot:		alias of auto

	hotplug:	Like auto but do some extra jobs, because hotplug indicates that the interface was just (un)registered. 
			These extra jobs contain (if configured) starting/stoping ifplugd, renaming inerface and removing all
			status files at ifdown
	
	
	manual:		This is default operation mode and sets up interfaces with STARTMODE=manual. If option rc is used that implies mode auto, you can force mode 'manual'

	
	rc: 		Special option for the use in rcnetwork (/etc/init.d/network)

	dhcp:		Indicates that script is called from dhcp cliend. When a interface has BOOTPROTO=dhcp ifup/down does not execute any post action immediately. After dhcp client got a
			lease and has set an ip addres, it call ifup again, this with option dhcp. In this run we finish interface setup.

	nodeps:		If there are interfaces based on this interface, ifdown takes these depending interfaces down first. If you don't like that use 'nodeps.

	prov=<n>	Use provider <n> instead that from config file. Only usefull for dialup interfaces

	debug 		Be verbose

	(no)syslog	With nosyslog the scripts don't send messages to syslog even if the configuration variable USE_SYSLOG is set to "yes". This is default for ifstatus only. If you want also 
			ifstatus messages send to syslog then call it with syslog 

FILES

	/sbin/ifup	
			The script itself

	/etc/sysconfig/network/config

			General configuration options

	/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-<configuration-name>
		
			Files containing configurations of devices. An example that shows a typical configuration with the name ifcf-eth0

			IPADDRESS=10.10.11.184
			NETMASK-255.255.00.0
			BROADCASET=10.10.255.255
			STARTMODE=onboot
			
	/etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-<configuration-name>

		You can specify individual routes for every configuration in these files

	/etc/sysconfig/network/if-{up,down}.d
		Scripts in these directories will be executed when any interface is started or brought down. They have to be executable and may also be binary. 
		The execution of these programs is controlled by the variable GLOBAL_POST_UP_EXEC and GLOBAL_PRE_DOWN_EXEC in the network configuration file
		/etc/sysconfig/network/config

	/etc/sysconfig/network/ifservices-<configuration-name>
		If you dont have a permanent network connection and you want certain services not to be started at boot time but started later when the network configuration has been
		started then you can add those services here


rcnetwork

	At boot time network devices are initiliazed asynchronously via hotplug. Once this initilisation process registered an interface for it thi will alos trigger a hotplug event 
	which will call ifup. If service netwrok was still not started ifup will just exit. As soon as service network is active ifup will do its job and set up the interface. So the job
	of network start consist of

		-set the 'network active' flag
		-set up all interfaces already available
		-wait for mandatory interfaces already available
		-set up tunnel, vlan et al

	At boot time the scripts try to determine the list of mandatory devices automatically. It considers all interfaces that have startmode 'auto'. It will wait 20 seconds for them but 
	will fail if they do not arrive in this time.

	Alternatively you may specify all mandatory devices manually in the variable MANDATORY_DEVICES in the file /etc/sysconfig/network/config. You may also change the timeout with
	WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES

DESCRIPTION

Manipulates the kernels IP routing tables. Its primary use is to set up static routes to specific hosts or network via an interface after it has been configured with ifconfig

OPTIONS

	-A family
	
		use specified addres family (e.g 'inet' user 'route --help' for a full list)

	-F
		operate on the kernels FIB (Forwarding Information Base) routing table. This is the default

	-C	
		operate on the kernels routing cache

	-v 	
		select verbose operation

	-n
		show numeric addresses rather then trying to determine symbolic hostnames. Usefull if trying to determine why the route to the name server has vanised.

	-e	
		use netstat format for displaying the routing table. -ee will generate a very long line with all parameters from the routing table

	del	
		delete a route

	add	
		add a new route

	target
		The destination network or host. You can provide IP addresses in dotted decimal or host/network names.

	-net 
		The target is a network

	-host 
		The traget is a host

	netmask M

		When adding network route, the netmask to be used.

	gw GW

		route packets via a gateway. NOTE the specified gateway must be reachable first. This usually mean the you have to set up a static rout to the gateway beforhand. If you
		specify the adress of one of you local interfaces, it will be used to decide about the interface to which the packet should be routed to. This is a BSDis compatibility hack

	metric
		set the metric to M (this value in the routing table is used by routing daemons)
	
	mss M
		set the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for connections over this route to M Bytes. The default is the device MTU minus headers or a lower MTU when the path mtu discovery occured. 
		This setting can be used to force smaller TCP packets on the other end when path mtu discovery does not work 

	window W
		set the TCP window size for connection sover this route to W bytes. This is typically only used on AX.25 netowrk an with drivers unable to handle back to back frames.

	irtt I
		set the initial round trip time for TCP connectionsover this route to I milliseconds (1-12000). This is typically only used on AX.25 networks. If ommited the RFC 1122 default of
		300ms is used

	reject
		install a blocking route, which will force the route lookup to fail. This for example used to mask out networks before using the default route. This is NOT for firewalling

	mod dyn reinstate

		install a dynamic or modified route. These are for diagnostic purposes are usually only set by daemons.

	dev If
	
		Force the route to be associate with the specified device, as the kernel witll otherwise try to determine the deive on its own ( by checking already existing routes and 
		device specifications, and where the route is added to)  
	

OUTPUT 

When not used with del/add the program will display all the routing table.

Routing table columsn are printed in the following order

	Destination: 
		
		The destination host or network

	Gateway:
		
		The gateway address. If no gateway is set for the route an asterisk is displayed
	

	Genmask:
		
		The netmask for the destination 255.255.255.255 is used for a host and 0.0.0.0 is used for the default route.
		
	RouteFlags:

		U Route is up.
		H Target is host
		G Uses a gateway
		R Reinstate route for dynamic routing
		D Dynamically installed by a daemon or redirect
		M Modified by routing daemon or redirect
		A installed by addrconf
		C cache entry
		! Rejected route

	Metric:

		Distance in hops to the target

	Ref:	
		Number of references to this route. This is displayed for compatibility with other route commands but is not used in the linux kernel

	Use:
		A count of lookups for the route. Depending on the user of -F -C the user is either cached misses (-F) or hits (-C)

	Iface:
		The interface to which packert for this route are sent.
++++++++++++++++++++++ifconfig++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	ifconfig [interface]
	ifconfig interface [aftype] options | address ...

ifconfig is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces. It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary. After that it is usually only needed when debugging

If no arguments ifconfig displays the status of all active interfaces

If a single argument is given it will display its status

If -a is given it display all interfaces even those that are not active.

Otherwise ifconfig will configure an interface.

OPTIONS 

	interface:	The name of an interface for example eth0 is the 				first ethernet connection

	up:		Causes te interface to be activate. It is implicitly
			included if an adress is assigned to the interface

	down:		Causes the driver for this interface to shutdown.

	 
	[-]arp:		Option is specific to broadcast networks such as 				Ethernets or packet radio. Enables the use of 				        Address Resolution protocol (ARP) to detect the 			        physical addresses of hosts attached to the network. 				For broadcast networks it is on by default, if ARP is
			disable ifconfig displays the NOARP flag.

	[-]promisc	If selected this interface will accept all packets on
			the network

	[-]allmulti	If selected all multicast packets on the network will be
			accept by the interface

	mtu N		If select sets the maximum transfer rate of the 
	    		interface

	netmask addr	Set the network mask for this interface. This defaults 
			to the usual class A B C network  mask as derived from 
			interface IP address but it can be set to any value.

	add[del] addr/prefixlen
			Add/delete an IPv6 address for an interface

	tunnel ::aa.bb.cc.dd
			Create a new SIT (IPv6 in IPv4) tunnelling to a given
			direction

	irq addr	Set the interupt line for this device. Not all devices
	    		can dynamically change there addresses

	io_addr addr	Set the I/O space address for this device
			
	mem_start addr	Set the start address for shared memory used by this dev			ice
